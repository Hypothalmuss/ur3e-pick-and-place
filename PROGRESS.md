## Feature 2: Robot bringup (Gazebo, URDF, controllers, TF)

- 2024-06-25: Created custom xacro `ur3e_with_effector.urdf.xacro` wrapping `ur_description` (ur3e) + `robotiq_description` (2F-85 gripper).

  - Overhead camera defined in world file with `libgazebo_ros_camera.so` plugin.
- 2024-06-25: Created `ur3e_workcell.world` with ground plane, table, green pick zone, red place zone, and overhead camera at (0.5, 0, 1.2).
- 2024-06-25: Created `ros2_controllers.yaml` with `joint_state_broadcaster`, `joint_trajectory_controller`, and `gripper_controller` (GripperActionController).
